# FoundryML

**This is still a work in progress and by far one of my most challenging and exciting projects!**

FoundryML is a self-learning agentic system specifically crafted for Machine Learning automation. Give it a train set, initiate the process, then sit back and watch the *magic* unfold!

## FoundryML provides the following features:
- Full Machine Learning process from data inspection, to preprocessing and feature engineer, to training with different models and optimizing, and finally evaluating.

- History of previous tasks along with their traces and final status (eg. fail, success) inside a DB. FoundryML can revisit these past tasks, compare current task, retrieve relevant useful information and apply in it in it's current task.

- Self-learning is achievable through the DB of previous tasks. FoundryML will go through failed tasks, troubleshoot what went wrong, come up with a new plan and execute it, and record new findings.
